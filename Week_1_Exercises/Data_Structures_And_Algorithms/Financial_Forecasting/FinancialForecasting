**********************************

**Concept of Recursion:

>>Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, similar tasks. For forecasting, recursion can repeatedly apply a growth formula to calculate future values, simplifying the computation process.

2. Setup
********

**Method Creation:

>>Create a method called calculateFutureValue that calculates future values using recursion. This method should take three parameters: initialValue (the starting amount), growthRate (the annual growth rate), and years (the number of years). The method should recursively compute the future value based on these inputs.

3. Implementation
*****************

**Recursive Algorithm:

>>Implement the calculateFutureValue method with the following logic:

>>Base Case: If years is 0, return the initialValue.

>>Recursive Case: Multiply the current initialValue by (1 + growthRate) and recursively call calculateFutureValue with years decremented by 1.

4. Analysis
***********

**Time Complexity:

>>The time complexity of the recursive method is O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call handles one year, leading to a linear number of calls relative to the number of years.

**Optimization:

>>To optimize and avoid excessive computation:

>>Memoization: Store results of previous calculations to prevent redundant work.

>>Iterative Approach: Consider using an iterative approach for large datasets to avoid the overhead of recursive calls.
