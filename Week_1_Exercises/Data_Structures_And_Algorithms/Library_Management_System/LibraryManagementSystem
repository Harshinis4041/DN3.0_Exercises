
1. Understand Search Algorithms
*******************************

**Linear Search:

>>Description: Checks each item sequentially until the target is found or the list ends.

>>Time Complexity: O(n). Suitable for small or unsorted lists.

**Binary Search:

>>Description: Divides the sorted list into halves repeatedly until the target is found or the search interval is empty.

>>Time Complexity: O(log n). Efficient for large, sorted lists.

2. Setup
********

>>Class Book:

>>Attributes:

>>bookId: Unique identifier.

>>title: Book title.

>>author: Book author.

3. Implementation
*****************

**Linear Search Implementation:

>>Class: BookSearch

>>Method: linearSearchByTitle

>>Description: Searches through an unsorted list of books by title.

>>Binary Search Implementation:


>>Class: BookSearch

>>Method: binarySearchByTitle

>>Description: Searches through a sorted array of books by title.

4. Analysis
***********

**Time Complexity Comparison:

>>Linear Search: O(n). Simple but slower for large lists.

>>Binary Search: O(log n). Faster but requires sorted data.

**When to Use:

>>Linear Search: Use for small or unsorted lists.

>>Binary Search: Use for large, sorted lists.
