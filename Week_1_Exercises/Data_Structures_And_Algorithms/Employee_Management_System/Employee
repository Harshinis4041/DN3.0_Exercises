
1. Understanding Array Representation:
**************************************

>>Array Representation: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory, which allows for quick access using indices.

**Advantages:

>>Fast access time (O(1)).

>>Simple and predictable memory usage.

2. Setup:
*********

**Class Employee:

>>employeeId: Unique ID.

>>name: Employee’s name.

>>position: Job title.

>>salary: Employee’s salary.

3. Implementation:
******************

>>Use an Array: Store Employee records in an array.

**Methods:

>>Add: Adds an employee to the array; resizes if needed.

>>Search: Finds an employee by employeeId.

>>Traverse: Lists all employees.

>>Delete: Removes an employee by employeeId and shifts remaining elements.

4. Analysis:
************

**Time Complexity:

>>Add: O(1) if no resize; O(n) if resizing.

>>Search: O(n) in the worst case.

>>Traverse: O(n) as it involves iterating through the array.

>>Delete: O(n) due to shifting elements.

**Limitations:

>>Fixed size: Array size is immutable without resizing.

>>Resizing is costly and inefficient for large data sets.

>>Inefficient insertions and deletions due to element shifting.

**When to Use:

>>Suitable for fixed-size collections where quick access is needed and resizing overhead is manageable.
