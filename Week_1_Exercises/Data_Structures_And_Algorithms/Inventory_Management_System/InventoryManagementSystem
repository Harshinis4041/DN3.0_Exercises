
1. Understanding the Problem
****************************

**Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

>>Scalability: Efficient data structures handle large inventories without performance issues.

>>Performance: Fast operations (add, update, delete, retrieve) ensure smooth system functionality.

>>Resource Efficiency: Proper algorithms minimize computational and memory overhead.

**Suitable Data Structures:

>>HashMap: Provides quick lookups, updates, and deletions with average time complexity of O(1).

>>ArrayList: Useful for ordered storage and iteration but has higher time complexity for lookups and deletions (O(n)).

2. Setup
********

>>Create a New Java Project: Name it InventoryManagementSystem.

**Add Classes:

>>Product: Represents individual products.

>>Inventory: Manages the collection of products.

>>InventoryManagementSystem: Demonstrates functionality with a main method.

3. Implementation
*****************

>>Product Class: Contains attributes like productId, productName, quantity, and price.

>>Inventory Class: Uses HashMap to store products and provides methods to add, update, delete, and retrieve products.

>>InventoryManagementSystem Class: Includes a main method to showcase the functionality of the Inventory class.

4. Analysis
***********

**Time Complexity

>>Add: O(1)

>>Update: O(1)

>>Delete: O(1)

>>Retrieve: O(1)

**Optimization

>>HashMap: Ensures efficient operations with average O(1) time complexity.

>>Concurrency: Use ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety in multi-threaded environments.

>>Memory Management: Monitor and manage memory usage for large inventories.
